# Claude Development Session Learnings

## Project Overview

This project was initialized on 2025-10-08 using juno-task.

**Main Task**: Build a comprehensive testing framework
**Preferred Subagent**: claude
**Project Root**: /Users/mahdiyar/Code/denmark_insightfactory/playground_juputer/projects/.vibe_trees/budi_cli_ts/juno-task-ts

## Development Environment

### Build System
- Use `npm run build` to build the project
- Test with `npm test` for unit tests
- Use `npm run test:binary` for CLI testing

### Key Commands
- `juno-task start` - Begin task execution
- `juno-task -s claude` - Quick execution with preferred subagent
- `juno-task feedback` - Provide feedback on the process

## AI Workflow

The project uses a sophisticated AI workflow with:

1. **Task Analysis**: Study existing codebase and requirements
2. **Specification Creation**: Detailed specs for each component
3. **Implementation**: AI-assisted development with parallel subagents
4. **Testing**: Automated testing and validation
5. **Documentation**: Continuous documentation updates
6. **Version Control**: Automated Git workflow management

## Important Notes

- Always check USER_FEEDBACK.md first for user input
- Keep plan.md up to date with current priorities
- Use up to 500 parallel subagents for analysis
- Use only 1 subagent for build/test operations
- Focus on full implementations, not placeholders
- Maintain comprehensive documentation

### 2025-10-16 — MCP Environment Variables Security Fix RESOLVED

- **Issue**: SECURITY VULNERABILITY - Environment variables configured in `.juno_task/mcp.json` were being overwritten, AND parent process environment was being inherited without user consent
- **Root Cause Discovery**: Three separate attempts revealed progressive security requirements:
  1. **2025-10-16 First Attempt**: Fixed environment variable loading from config but variables still overwritten by hardcoded values
  2. **2025-10-17 Second Attempt**: Fixed overwriting but introduced `...process.env` spreading, creating security risk by inheriting parent environment
  3. **2025-10-16 Final Resolution**: Complete process isolation - removed ALL `...process.env` spreading
- **Security Requirements**: MCP server processes must have complete environment isolation:
  - NO inheritance from parent process environment
  - ONLY hardcoded secure defaults + explicit user configuration
  - Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive parent environment variables
- **Final Solution**: Updated all three StdioClientTransport creation points in `src/mcp/client.ts`:
  - Line 646: Removed `...process.env`, kept only hardcoded defaults + user config
  - Line 779: Same security fix for per-operation connections
  - Line 798: Same security fix for direct server path connections
  - Environment merging: `hardcoded_defaults` + `user_config` (NO parent env)
- **Test Results**:
  - ✅ Build successful, 573 unit tests passing
  - ✅ Security verification: no parent environment inheritance
  - ✅ User configuration properly applied from mcp.json
  - ✅ Complete process isolation achieved
- **Key Learning**: Always validate security requirements before implementing environment variable fixes. Process isolation is critical for MCP server security.
