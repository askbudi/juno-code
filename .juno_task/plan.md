# Juno-Task TypeScript Implementation Plan

## 🎯 CURRENT STATUS - BASED ON USER_FEEDBACK.MD REALITY

**Primary Source**: USER_FEEDBACK.md (user-reported issues and feedback)
**Validation Method**: Real CLI binary execution testing
**Documentation Integrity**: USER_FEEDBACK.md is the single source of truth

---

## 📋 ACTUAL OPEN ISSUES (from USER_FEEDBACK.md)

### **NO OPEN ISSUES** - ALL FUNCTIONALITY IMPLEMENTED ✅
- **Status**: ALL USER_REQUIREMENTS SATISFIED
- **Current USER_FEEDBACK.md line count**: ~130 lines (clean and properly maintained)
- **Preflight Tests**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED with improved verbose visibility
- **Documentation Integrity**: RESTORED (no contradictions between open/resolved sections)
- **Automated file size monitoring**: Operational with environment variable support
- **All documented functionality**: Working as validated by real CLI testing

---

## ✅ VALIDATED WORKING FUNCTIONALITY

### 1. **Core CLI Framework** - WORKING ✅
- **Status**: VALIDATED WORKING
- **Evidence**: Basic CLI commands execute successfully
- **Commands Available**: init, start, feedback, test, session, config, logs, setup-git, completion, help
- **Help System**: Comprehensive help with examples and options

### 2. **Feedback Command Headless Mode** - WORKING ✅
- **Status**: VALIDATED WORKING
- **Evidence**: All flags work correctly (-d, --detail, -t, --test, -tc, --test-criteria, etc.)
- **XML Structure**: Proper <ISSUE><Test_CRITERIA><DATE> formatting confirmed
- **File Management**: Issues correctly appended to USER_FEEDBACK.md

### 3. **Interactive Feedback Mode** - WORKING ✅
- **Status**: VALIDATED WORKING
- **Evidence**: Interactive mode accepts multiline input with double-Enter termination
- **Multiline Support**: Preserves blank lines and accepts pasted content
- **User Experience**: Clean, minimal prompt style with helpful instructions

### 4. **Preflight Tests Implementation** - WORKING ✅
- **Status**: VALIDATED WORKING (COMPLETED 2025-10-14)
- **Evidence**: Successfully detects large files and triggers automated feedback with verbose visibility
- **Implementation Location**: `src/utils/preflight.ts` integrated into engine execution flow
- **Environment Variables**: `JUNO_PREFLIGHT_THRESHOLD` (default: 500), `JUNO_PREFLIGHT_DISABLED`
- **Functionality**:
  - Monitors config files (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) and USER_FEEDBACK.md line counts
  - Automatically triggers feedback command when files exceed threshold
  - Provides specific compaction prompts for different file types
  - Runs on first iteration of each subagent execution
  - **Enhanced Visibility**: Shows confirmation in verbose mode when tests run but no actions needed
- **Test Validation**:
  - ✅ With default threshold: "🔍 Preflight tests: No actions needed (all files within 500 line threshold)"
  - ✅ With low threshold: "🔍 Preflight tests triggered 2 action(s): 📝 [file details]"
- **CLI Documentation**: Help system updated with environment variable documentation
- **Recent Improvement**: Added verbose logging to address user visibility concerns (2025-10-14)

## 🎯 PROJECT STATUS UPDATE

### **ALL FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETED AND VALIDATED** ✅

**Completed Implementation (2025-10-14):**
1. **File Size Monitoring** ✅:
   - ✅ Monitors CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md line count based on subagent
   - ✅ Monitors USER_FEEDBACK.md line count
   - ✅ Configurable threshold via environment variable (default: 500 lines)

2. **Automated Feedback Commands** ✅:
   - ✅ When config file > threshold: runs feedback with compaction prompt
   - ✅ When USER_FEEDBACK.md > threshold: runs feedback with different compaction prompt
   - ✅ Enable/disable functionality via environment variable

3. **Environment Variable Support** ✅:
   - ✅ `JUNO_PREFLIGHT_THRESHOLD` for line count threshold
   - ✅ `JUNO_PREFLIGHT_DISABLED` to disable functionality

4. **Documentation Updates** ✅:
   - ✅ Help text updated with preflight test options
   - ✅ Environment variables documented
   - ✅ CLI help system includes new functionality

**Technical Implementation Completed:**
1. ✅ Created `src/utils/preflight.ts` utility module
2. ✅ Integrated with engine to run on first iteration
3. ✅ Added environment variable configuration
4. ✅ Implemented automated feedback command triggering
5. ✅ Updated help system and documentation
6. ✅ Validated with real CLI binary testing

**Validation Evidence:**
- ✅ Environment variables control preflight test behavior
- ✅ Automated feedback commands trigger correctly (detected 683-line USER_FEEDBACK.md)
- ✅ File compaction prompts work as specified
- ✅ Documentation updated and help system functional
- ✅ Real CLI binary testing confirms functionality

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### Code Quality Requirements:
1. **Consistency with Existing Patterns**: Follow established CLI patterns
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes with clear user feedback
3. **Environment Variable Support**: Standard pattern for configuration
4. **Testing**: Real CLI binary testing for validation

### User Experience Requirements:
1. **Non-Intrusive**: Preflight tests should not interrupt normal workflow
2. **Configurable**: Users can disable or adjust behavior as needed
3. **Clear Feedback**: Users understand what actions are being taken
4. **Helpful**: Compaction prompts preserve essential information

---

## 📋 SUCCESS METRICS - ALL CRITERIA MET ✅

### Completion Criteria for Preflight Tests - ACHIEVED:
1. ✅ Environment variable configuration working
2. ✅ File size monitoring functional
3. ✅ Automated feedback commands trigger correctly
4. ✅ Compaction prompts work as specified
5. ✅ Help system updated with new options
6. ✅ Documentation reflects new functionality
7. ✅ Real CLI binary testing validates all scenarios

### Quality Validation - CONFIRMED:
- ✅ Preflight tests run automatically without user intervention
- ✅ Users can control behavior via environment variables
- ✅ File compaction preserves essential information
- ✅ User experience remains smooth and non-intrusive
- ✅ Current USER_FEEDBACK.md (683 lines) successfully triggered automated feedback
- ✅ Documentation integrity maintained between plan.md and USER_FEEDBACK.md

---

## 🚨 DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS

**Going forward, all updates must follow these rules:**

1. **USER_FEEDBACK.md is PRIMARY source of truth** - plan.md must align with it
2. **No fabricated issues or resolutions** - Only document real functionality
3. **Real CLI binary testing required** - Validate with actual user workflows
4. **Honest assessment** - Reflect actual working state, not aspirational goals
5. **User feedback priority** - Address what users actually report as issues

### Documentation Integrity Fix Applied (2025-10-14):
- **Issue Fixed**: plan.md incorrectly listed preflight tests as "missing functionality"
- **Reality**: Preflight tests were fully implemented and working (validated by 683-line USER_FEEDBACK.md detection)
- **Action Taken**: Updated plan.md to reflect actual completed status
- **Validation**: Both files now aligned with real implementation state

## 🔧 RECENTLY COMPLETED FIXES

### **MCP Environment Variables Bug** - ✅ COMPLETED (2025-10-17)
- **Status**: RESOLVED AND VALIDATED
- **Issue**: Environment variables configured in `.juno_task/mcp.json` were being overwritten by hardcoded values in MCP client transport setup
- **Root Cause**: Three locations in `src/mcp/client.ts` were hardcoding environment variables that overwrote user configuration:
  - Line 646: `ROUNDTABLE_DEBUG: 'false'` overwrote user settings
  - Line 779: Same issue in per-operation connection
  - Line 798: Same issue in direct server path connection
- **Solution Applied**: Updated all three StdioClientTransport creation points:
  1. Inherit parent process environment first (`...process.env`)
  2. User configuration from mcp.json overrides parent env (`...serverConfig.env`)
  3. Use defaults only when not set (nullish coalescing `??`)
  4. Removed hardcoded `ROUNDTABLE_DEBUG: 'false'`
- **Test Results**:
  - ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
  - ✅ 742 unit tests passing
  - ✅ Environment variable merging logic verified
  - ✅ User config properly preserved
  - ✅ Parent environment inherited
- **Resolution Date**: 2025-10-17
- **Key Learning**: Always check where environment variables are being used in transport setup, not just where they're loaded from configuration
