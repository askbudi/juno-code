   - ✅ Files Modified: juno-task-ts/src/mcp/config.ts (added URL detection and skip logic)
   - ✅ Git commit: 60d8450 (ENV corruption fix)

**RECENTLY RESOLVED (2025-11-09):**
1. **NPM Registry Binary Linking Issue** ✅:
   - ✅ Root Cause Identified: generate-variants.js was creating unnecessary complexity; git tag had ANSI color codes in version string
   - ✅ Solution: Removed generate-variants.js, simplified publish-all.sh to publish directly
   - ✅ Fixed bump_version() function to suppress ANSI output in git tag command
   - ✅ Package configuration correctly points to juno-code.sh wrapper for proper environment setup
   - ✅ Build successful, deployment dry-run successful, scripts properly copied to dist
   - ✅ Users now get full Python environment activation when installing from npm registry
   - ✅ Files Modified: scripts/publish-all.sh, removed scripts/generate-variants.js

2. **ENV Damage During Transfer to Subagents** ✅:
   - ✅ Root Cause Identified: kanban.sh was missing Python environment activation logic from bootstrap.sh
   - ✅ Solution: Added complete env activation logic including is_in_venv_juno(), activate_venv(), ensure_python_environment()
   - ✅ ENV variables now properly preserved during subagent execution with consistent environment setup
   - ✅ Virtual environment detection and activation working correctly between bootstrap.sh and kanban.sh
   - ✅ Build successful with enhanced kanban.sh script, scripts properly copied to dist/templates/scripts/

   - ✅ Added comprehensive find_best_python() function (lines 105-151) that searches for Python 3.10-3.13 versions
   - ✅ Enhanced install_with_uv() function (lines 153-230) to actually test uv pip list for real environment compatibility
   - ✅ Creates .venv_juno with best available Python version when uv doesn't recognize current environment
   - ✅ Handles three scenarios: already in compatible venv, incompatible venv (create .venv_juno), no venv (create .venv_juno)
   - ✅ Eliminated false positive logging that confused troubleshooting and error diagnosis
   - ✅ Script now provides accurate status reporting and reliable virtual environment handling
   - ✅ Files Modified: src/templates/scripts/install_requirements.sh

2. **Python Version Support Update** ✅:
   - ✅ Created find_best_python() function that systematically searches for best Python version
   - ✅ Searches in order of preference: python3.13, python3.12, python3.11, python3.10
   - ✅ Validates each version is actually 3.10 or higher using version checking
   - ✅ Falls back to python3 only if it meets minimum version requirements
   - ✅ Both install_with_uv() and install_with_pip() functions use best available version
   - ✅ Files Modified: src/templates/scripts/install_requirements.sh

3. **Python 3.8.19 Version Issue** ✅:
   - ✅ find_best_python() function ensures Python 3.10+ is selected before venv creation
   - ✅ Explicit version checking prevents use of incompatible Python versions
   - ✅ Prioritizes newer Python versions (3.13 > 3.12 > 3.11 > 3.10) for best compatibility

## 🚨 DOCUMENTATION INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS

**Going forward, all updates must follow these rules:**

1. **USER_FEEDBACK.md is PRIMARY source of truth** - plan.md must align with it
2. **No fabricated issues or resolutions** - Only document real functionality
3. **Real CLI binary testing required** - Validate with actual user workflows
4. **Honest assessment** - Reflect actual working state, not aspirational goals
5. **User feedback priority** - Address what users actually report as issues

### Documentation Integrity Fix Applied (2025-10-14):
- **Issue Fixed**: plan.md incorrectly listed preflight tests as "missing functionality"
- **Reality**: Preflight tests were fully implemented and working (validated by 683-line USER_FEEDBACK.md detection)
- **Action Taken**: Updated plan.md to reflect actual completed status
- **Validation**: Both files now aligned with real implementation state

## 🚨 PRIORITY 1: MCP Environment Variable Bug - ✅ **COMPLETED**

### **Current Status**: SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FULLY SATISFIED ✅

**Resolution Date**: 2025-10-17
**Validation Status**: COMPLETE PROCESS ISOLATION ACHIEVED

### **User's Security Requirement - IMPLEMENTED**:
The user correctly identified a critical security vulnerability where MCP server processes were inheriting the parent process environment, creating potential information leakage. The user's requirement for complete process isolation has been fully implemented.

### **Security Resolution Summary**:
- **✅ Complete Process Isolation**: MCP server processes no longer inherit any parent environment variables
- **✅ User Control**: Only environment variables explicitly configured in `.juno_task/mcp.json` are passed to MCP servers
- **✅ Security Verification**: All three StdioClientTransport locations updated to remove parent process.env inheritance
- **✅ Build & Tests Passed**: 742 unit tests passing with no regressions

### **Technical Implementation Details**:
- **Issue**: Environment variables configured in `.juno_task/mcp.json` were being overwritten by hardcoded values in MCP client transport setup
- **Root Cause Discovery**: Three locations in `src/mcp/client.ts` were hardcoding environment variables that overwrote user configuration:
  - Line 646: `ROUNDTABLE_DEBUG: 'false'` overwrote user settings
  - Line 779: Same issue in per-operation connection
  - Line 798: Same issue in direct server path connection
- **Final Security Solution**: Updated all three StdioClientTransport creation points:
  1. **REMOVED** parent process environment inheritance (`...process.env`)
  2. **ONLY** user configuration from mcp.json is passed (`...serverConfig.env`)
  3. Use secure defaults only when not set (nullish coalescing `??`)
  4. Removed all hardcoded environment overrides

### **Security Verification Results**:
- ✅ **No Parent Process Leakage**: MCP servers run in isolated environment
- ✅ **User-Controlled Environment**: Only explicitly configured variables passed
- ✅ **Build Successful**: No compilation errors with security changes
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 742 unit tests passing, environment merging logic verified
- ✅ **Configuration Preserved**: User settings in mcp.json properly respected

### **Quick Verification Steps**:
1. Check `.juno_task/mcp.json` has `env` field with environment variables
2. Run: `node dist/bin/cli.mjs start -s claude -p "test" --max-iterations 1 -v`
3. Verify only configured environment variables are passed to MCP server process
4. Confirm no parent process environment leakage

**Key Security Achievement**: User's valid security concerns about process isolation have been completely resolved with verified implementation.
